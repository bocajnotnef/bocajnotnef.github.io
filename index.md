# interests

## Security

I've been interested in security since a relatively young age, exploring things like configuring
VPNs and exploring cryptographic standards like PGP. I hadn't had a chance to more thoroughly
explore the field until I took a security course at MSU this semester. I would like to explore this
more.

## Research

I spent a summer working at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action where I
developed an agent-based model of quorum-sensing organisms to better understand the circumstances
that allowed them to evolve. I presented my findings at the 2016 BEACON congress held at MSU.

## Personal

In my free time I dabble with photography, gaming (both board and video), and reading. I'm always
looking for science fiction and cyberpunk recommendations, as well as interesting reading in
general.
