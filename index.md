# whoami 

I am a third year computer science student at Michigan State University. I have interests in
networking and security and have worked as a learning assistant and a research assistant over the
past three years.

# interests

## security

I've been interested in security since a relatively young age, exploring things like configuring
VPNs and exploring cryptographic standards like PGP. I hadn't had a chance to more thoroughly
explore the field until I took a security course at MSU this semester. I would like to explore this
more.

## research

I spent a summer working at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action where I
developed an agent-based model of quorum-sensing organisms to better understand the circumstances
that allowed them to evolve. I presented my findings at the 2016 BEACON congress held at MSU.

## personal

In my free time I dabble with photography, gaming (both board and video), and reading. I'm always
looking for science fiction and cyberpunk recommendations, as well as interesting reading in
general. 

# projects

## Empirical

[Empirical](https://github.com/devosoft/empirical) is a software library for developing scientific programs that can be cross-compiled into javascript through the use of [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).

The goal of Empirical is to make both the development and repduction of scientific programs
trivial. The project is headed by Dr. Charles Ofria. I was brought on in September of 2015, when I
began adding infastructure like autodocumentation via Doxygen, Breathe and Sphinx, Continuous
Integration with testing via Catch and adding protocols like the two person merge rule to the
project.

## khmer 

[khmer](https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer) is a software library and a set of utilities for working
with DNA sequencing data. I worked with the project from October 2014 to August 2015, during which
time the project migrated to University of California: Davis. The project is headed by Dr. C Titus Brown. I primarily did refacoring work on the libraries python scripts. 

## ACM @ MSU

I am a co-president of the board for the MSU chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery. We
work with professors, grad students, and companies from the local area to put on technical
discussions for the benefit of the student body here at MSU. We've had talks range from tutorials
on D3, git, and Haskell to a Q&A session with the interim CIO and deputy CISO.
